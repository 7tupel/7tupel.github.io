Have you ever heard of Clojure? I have and I love it. But first things first. Clojure is a functional programming language from the Lisp family.



- **Why Clojure?**
  - Simplicity
    - Super Simple Syntax
    - S-Expressions (Do not Fear!)
  - Functional
    - Compositional Design
    - Almost no Side Effects -> They are the source of many evils
  - Immutability
    - reduces error rate
    - forces to think ahead
  - Homoiconicity
    - ~ Code = Data
    - *A homoiconic program can be manipulated same as data using the language. Thus the program's internal representation can be inferred just by reading the program itself*
  - Polymorphism
    - One of the best Object Oriented Programming Models <- In a Functional Language!
